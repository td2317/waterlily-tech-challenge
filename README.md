# Waterlily Tech Challenge — Full-stack MVP (3-hour build)
This repository contains my submission for the **Waterlily Technical Take-Home Challenge**.  
The assignment was to design and implement a simple end-to-end survey application where users can log in, answer questions, submit their responses, and then review them.  

My goal was not only to get it working, but to **demonstrate thought process, trade-offs, and decision making** — exactly how I would approach building something real under time constraints.

## 🎯 Project Overview

At its core, the system has three flows:

1. **Authentication** → Users can register and log in. Successful login returns a JWT that must be sent with protected requests.  
2. **Survey Lifecycle** → A survey has a title and questions. Users can fetch surveys, pick one, and answer the questions.  
3. **Response Submission & Review** → Answers are submitted back to the backend and stored. Users can then review what they just submitted.  

I implemented a **full stack solution** with Node.js + TypeScript for the backend and React + Vite for the frontend. The database layer uses SQLite so data persists across restarts, and I styled the UI quickly using TailwindCSS.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript  
- **Auth:** JWT + middleware protection  
- **Validation:** Zod (ensures payloads are correct before hitting the DB)  
- **Database:** SQLite (via better-sqlite3 for simplicity)  
- **Frontend:** React (Vite + TypeScript), TailwindCSS  
- **Tooling:** Nodemon, ts-node, dotenv

## ⚖️ Trade-offs & Design Decisions

This assignment was scoped to ~3 hours. To keep within that limit, I made a few intentional trade-offs:

- **SQLite (better-sqlite3) instead of Prisma ORM**  
  Prisma is powerful for schema migrations and type-safety, but setting it up and running migrations takes extra time. For speed, I used SQLite with a thin wrapper. This let me persist data reliably without migration overhead.  
  👉 In a production system, I would absolutely use Prisma (or another ORM) for maintainability and schema evolution.

- **Single-page frontend instead of full routing**  
  I consolidated the frontend into a single `App.tsx` that switches between “login → home → survey → review” stages. This avoided boilerplate and still shows the full user flow.  
  👉 In future iterations, I’d split this into proper routes (`/login`, `/survey/:id`, `/review`) for clarity.

- **Minimal UI styling**  
  I used Tailwind for quick, consistent styles without spending hours polishing pixels. The focus was on functionality, correctness, and clean code.

These choices allowed me to cover **all required functionality** end-to-end while keeping the project achievable in the time limit.

## 📦 Setup Instructions

Clone the repo, then run both backend and frontend separately.

## Backend

```bash
cd waterlily-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Runs at http://localhost:3000  
- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /auth/register` – create account  
  - `POST /auth/login` – get JWT  
  - `GET /surveys` – list all surveys  
  - `GET /surveys/:id` – fetch one survey  
  - `POST /surveys/responses` – submit a response (requires JWT)  
  - `GET /surveys/:id/responses` – view all responses
    
**Frontend:**

```bash
cd waterlily-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Runs at http://localhost:5173  
- Talks to the backend via API calls (CORS is enabled).  

**Typical Flow to Test**

1.	Register

POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register
{ "email": "me@test.com", "password": "secret123" }

2.	Login → copy the returned token.
3.	Frontend login → enter email/password → token is stored in localStorage.
4.	List surveys → frontend fetches GET /surveys.
5.	Take a survey → frontend fetches GET /surveys/:id and renders inputs.
6.	Submit answers → frontend posts to POST /surveys/responses with { surveyId, answers }.
7.	Review → frontend shows a summary of what you submitted.

**Challenges & Debugging**

Along the way I hit a few real-world issues:
	•	CORS errors – fixed by adding middleware with origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN.
	•	401 Unauthorized – caused by missing/incorrect JWT headers. Solved by attaching Authorization: Bearer <token> in the frontend helper.
	•	204 No Content on submission – page went blank; root cause was not awaiting the API response before navigating. Fixed by handling async properly.
	•	Strict TypeScript errors – TypeScript required explicit types for survey/response objects; I added inline interfaces and mappings.

Each of these mirrors real engineering work: diagnosing errors, finding root causes, and fixing with clean solutions.

**Future Improvements**

Given more time, here’s what I would add:
	•	Swap SQLite for Prisma ORM with migrations and relations.
	•	Split frontend into multiple routes (/login, /survey/:id, /review).
	•	Add form validation (required fields, type checks).
	•	Improve survey UX (next/previous navigation, progress indicator).
	•	Deploy backend (Render/Heroku) + frontend (Vercel/Netlify) for live demo.

**Summary**

This project demonstrates how I approach building a small but complete system under time constraints:
	•	Start with a clear request flow,
	•	Make pragmatic trade-offs,
	•	Get end-to-end functionality working,
	•	Handle errors thoughtfully,
	•	Leave room for clear improvements.
